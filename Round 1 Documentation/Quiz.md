## Case Study Sample

### Scenario:
A robot is tasked with delivering packages in a school simulation. During its journey, the robot detects a blocked path.

### Problem:
What steps should the robot follow to complete its task?

### Coding Steps:
1. Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect if the path is blocked.  
2. If blocked, turn 90° to the right and continue forward.  
3. If the alternate path is also blocked, try turning 90° to the left.  
4. Resume the original path once the blockage is cleared.

**Question:** Based on the case study, what should the robot do if the path is clear?  
   - [ ] Turn left  
   - [x] Move forward  
   - [ ] Stop and wait
