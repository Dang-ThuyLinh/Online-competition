**Question Stems and Topics (for the remaining questions):**

I will continue to use the established pattern: simple language, relatable scenarios, and focus on the core concepts.  Here are *additional* question stems and topic ideas, to help guide the creation of the remaining questions:

**Computational Thinking (Decomposition):**

*   True/False: "Getting ready for school can be broken down into smaller steps."

*   Fill-in-the-Blank: "A step in drawing a cat is to draw the ______." (tail, ears, body, etc.)
*   Drag-and-Drop: "Order the steps for planting a seed." (e.g., "Dig a hole," "Put seed in hole," "Water the seed")
*   More scenarios about everyday activities like making a simple snack, getting ready for bed, cleaning up toys.

*   True/False: "AB, AB, AB is a pattern."
*   True/False: "1, 2, 3, 5, 6 is a counting pattern."
*   Multiple Choice (Single): "What comes next: Circle, Square, Triangle, Circle, ______?"
*   Multiple Choice (Multiple): "Which of these follow a pattern? (Select all that apply)" (Mix patterned and non-patterned sequences)
*   Matching: "Match the pattern to its rule." (e.g., ABAB - "Repeat AB")
*   Drag-and-Drop: "Continue the pattern by dragging the correct shapes/colors." (Provide visual patterns).
*   More visual patterns (shapes, colors, sizes).
*   Simple number patterns (adding 1, adding 2, even/odd).
*   Patterns with objects/actions (e.g., clap, snap, clap, snap...).

*   Fill-in-the-Blank: "A robot can follow ______ to do a task." (instructions, a program)

**AI Ethics (Simple Scenarios):**

*   True/False: "It's okay to tell a computer program to lie."
*   True/False: "Computer programs should always be fair to everyone."

*   Multiple Choice (Multiple): "What should you do if a website asks for your picture?" (Options: post it, ask a grownup, ignore it)
*   Fill-in-the-Blank: "You should never share your ______ with a computer program." (password, address, name)
*   Scenarios about:
    *   Fairness in games (e.g., "Is it okay for a game to be easier for some players than others?")
    *   Responsibility for AI actions (e.g., "Who is responsible if a robot breaks something?")
    *   Privacy (e.g., "Should a smart toy record everything you say?")
    *  Trust and truthfulness (should a computer program tell the truth)

This detailed plan, along with the question stems and example questions, provides a comprehensive starting point for creating the 100 unique questions for Group A. Remember, the key is to keep the questions simple, relatable, and focused on the core concepts, while adhering strictly to the guidelines and template.
