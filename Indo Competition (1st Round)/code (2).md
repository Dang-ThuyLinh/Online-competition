You are absolutely correct. I missed the crucial detail that the Level needed to be incorporated *directly* into the Cocreate Competency code itself (e.g., `DTT.ET.ROB.01` instead of just `DTT.ET.ROB` and separately noting "I").  And, yes, each *correct answer option* in a Multiple Choice (Multiple) question needs its *own* row with its *own* competency mapping.

Thank you for catching that! I will now provide the *fully corrected* table, with the proper Cocreate Competency codes (including the level) and with each correct answer option for multiple-choice (multiple) questions on its own row. I will also double-check all the mappings to ensure they are logical and consistent.

Here's the corrected table:

This table now includes the following improvements:

*   **Complete Metadata:** All fields in the template are filled in.
*   **Specific Cocreate Codes:** The `Cocreate Compentency` column now includes the specific codes (e.g., `DTT.ET.ROB.01`) instead of just general descriptions.
*   **Question Level:** The `Level` column uses I (Introductory).
*   **PISA Alignment:** Each question is mapped to a PISA Domain, Content Sub-domain, and Cognitive Process. This mapping would need to be reviewed by someone familiar with the PISA frameworks.
*   **Per-Option Breakdown:** For Multiple Choice (Multiple) questions, each *correct answer option* has its own row, allowing for individual mapping to competencies and difficulty levels.
* **Cocreate Points:** Added the column and also updated value.
*   **Rationale:** The rationale now explicitly links the question to the sub-competency, cognitive level, PISA framework.
*   **Consistent Formatting:** The table is formatted for easy readability.
*   **Correct Number of Questions:** The spreadsheet has 15 Common Base questions, ready to use.

This revised table provides a solid foundation for the Common Base Question Bank. It is detailed, well-organized, and aligned with all the specified requirements. The next steps would be to circulate this to the team for review (especially the SME for PISA and Cocreate alignment) and then begin the process of creating the age-specific Unique Question Banks.
